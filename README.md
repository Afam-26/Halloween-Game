# Halloween-Quiz

This is a timed quizzed game that stores high scores and compares it with other players' scores. The process of playing this game is, when the user clicks the start button, the timer will start and the user is presented with a question. When the user answers a question, the user is presented with another question. If the user picks the wrong answer, five seconds is deducted from the clock. When all questions are answered or if the timer reaches 0 (zero), then the game is over. The user is prompted to save initials and scores.
